    <div id="circle1" style="width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: rgba(60, 190, 5, 0.808);
    border: 4px solid black;
    border-radius: 50%;">CIRCLE</div>
    <div>every time we need to create a circle in html,<br>
we make a box with some height and width, and add border to it--> then we set the border radius to 50% inorder to make it a circle</div>
<br><br>
    <div><b>6Aug2023</b><br>Visiblity: hidden; means space will be reserved for that object, but display: none; means no space will be reserved and that object wont be present in webpage</div>
    <div>in RGBA <br> A is aplha- it tells us about the opacity of color, it ranges from 0 to 1</div>
<br><br>    
    <div style="border:5px solid black; margin: 10px; ">
        <div style="border:5px solid black; margin: 10px;">this is a border over multiple divs having border</div>
        <div style="border:5px solid black; margin: 10px;">this is a border over multiple divs having border</div>
        <div style="border:5px solid black; margin: 10px;">this is a border over multiple divs having border</div>
    </div>

    <p>if we want to create a whole border over some already exiting boxes, just put them in another div and add border to it</p>

    <b>Various units in Css</b><br>
    
        <pre>CSS provides us with different 
            px, cm and inches - these are absolute units
            %, em, rem - are relative units
            %- means how much the elements size should be, in comparision with the parent element
            em- this is used to make one element bigger or smaller with-respect to parent element
            like if text size is 10px;
            and child element have size 2em, it will be 20px(twice the size of parent element)
            in case of width, if set width:5em;
            it will be 5 times the font size of the child element
            
            in short, font-size(of the same element) will become the base for each element with size in em
            rem- is used to make the element size relative to the most outter element(body) present in our webpage
            for eg- if we have some text directly inside body tag with font-size:16px;
                and I set size of any element 5rem, then it will be 5 times 16(5 x 16= 80px)
            
            OTHER units::
                vh= viewport height- relative height to that of the browser(or webpage) height
                vm= viewport width - relative width to that of the browsers(or webpage) width
        </pre>
    </div>
